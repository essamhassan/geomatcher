# GeoMatcher
Sample application that reads a list of users from a json file and return only those within a certain distance from a certain geopoint sorted by their id. this can be accessible from API or "much simpler" by running the command `rails runner bin/geomatcher`. I used rails fully aware it was an overkill for such a simple application yet the framework conventions gives you better understanding for how the app is structured


for testing run `rails test`
